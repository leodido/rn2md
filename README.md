# release note to markdown

> Generate markdown for your changelogs from release-note blocks

It expects release-note block rows to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.

Then, it extracts the `type` and creates different sections in the resulting markdown for different `type`.

For example `new: ...` and `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` release-note rows populate the "Major Changes" section of the markdown.

## Usage

```bash
rn2md -o falcosecurity -m 0.21.0 -r falco
```
